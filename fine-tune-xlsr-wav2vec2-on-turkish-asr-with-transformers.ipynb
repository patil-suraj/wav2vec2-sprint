    "Wav2Vec2 is a pretrained model for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and was released in [September 2020](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/wav2vec-20-learning-the-structure-of-speech-from-raw-audio/) by Alexei Baevski, Michael Auli, and Alex Conneau.  Soon after the superior performance of Wav2Vec2 was demonstrated on the English ASR dataset LibriSpeech, *Facebook AI* presented XLSR-Wav2Vec2 (click [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.13979)). XLSR stands for *cross-lingual  speech representations* and refers to XLSR-Wav2Vec2`s ability to learn speech representations that are useful across multiple languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to Wav2Vec2, XLSR-Wav2Vec2 learns powerful speech representations from hundreds of thousands of hours of speech in more than 50 languages of unlabeled speech. Similar, to [BERT's masked language modeling](http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-bert/), the model learns contextualized speech representations by randomly masking feature vectors before passing them to a transformer network.\n",
